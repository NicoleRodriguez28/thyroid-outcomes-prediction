# Introduction
This project explores patterns and predictors of thyroid cancer recurrence in patients treated with Radioactive Iodine (RAI) therapy. The data used within this analysis is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aneevinay/thyroid-cancer-recurrence-dataset). By analyzing demographic, pathological, and clinical variables, the goal is to better understand which factors are most strongly associated with recurrence and how treatment responses vary across different patient groups.

Findings show that recurrence is most common in papillary carcinoma—especially among males—and in patients aged 31–50. Stage I is the most frequent stage, often associated with an excellent treatment response, while treatment response shows the strongest correlation with recurrence.

Understanding these patterns is crucial for improving risk prediction and tailoring treatment strategies to reduce recurrence and enhance long-term outcomes for thyroid cancer patients.

## Description of data

This dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aneevinay/thyroid-cancer-recurrence-dataset) focuses on patients with thyroid cancer recurrence after receiving Radioactive Iodine (RAI) therapy. This data is important due to it's capability to predict cancer recurrence in patients, understanding factors that increase the risk of these diagnoses, and exploring different treatment outcomes.

# Data Analysis 
## Correlation Analysis
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

To obtain the correlation between variables in this dataset, **Spearman** was used because it correctly ranks values ratther than using absolute magnitudes and is best for ordinal and non-parametric data. 

- Correlation between **Risk** and other variables:
 - Hx Radiotherapy: weak
 - Adenopathy: weak

- Correlation between **Recurred** and other variables: 
  - **Strong Correlation**
    - Response
    - N
  - **Moderate Correlation**
    - Stage
    - T
    - M
    - Focality
    - Gender
  - **Weak Correlation**
    - Pathology
    
> The strongest predictors of recurrence by Spearman's rho: response, N stage, T stage, and focality

## Chart/Graph 
### Heatmap
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a data frame of correlation results
cor_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Gender", "Stage", "Response", "Pathology", 
               "T", "N", "M", "Focality"),
  Rho = c(0.328, 0.417, 0.662, 0.088, 0.537, 0.630, 
          0.354, -0.384)
)

# Order variables by strength of correlation
cor_data$Variable <- factor(cor_data$Variable, 
                            levels = cor_data$Variable[order(cor_data$Rho)])

# Heatmap
ggplot(cor_data, aes(x = "Recurred", y = Variable, fill = Rho)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  # Text
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Rho, 3)), color = "black") +
  # Color
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "lightgreen", 
                       mid = "orange", high = "red", midpoint = 0) +
  # Labels
  labs(title = "Spearman Correlation with Recurred", x = "", y = "") +
  # Theme
  theme_minimal()
```

This heatmap reveals the strength of correlation that the variables have with recurrence. The variable with the highest correlation to recurrence is response, while focality has the least. This is important because it highlights how treatment response contributes to thyroid cancer coming back in these patients. Being able to find ways to maximize the effectiveness and response to these treatments is crucial for the long-term health of patients. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Age Groups
thyroid_data$Age_Group <- cut(thyroid_data$Age, breaks = c(0, 30, 50, 70, 100), 
                              labels = c("0–30", "31–50", "51–70", "71+"), right = FALSE)

# Recurrence per age group
age_recurr <- as.data.frame(table(thyroid_data$Age_Group, thyroid_data$Recurred))
colnames(age_recurr) <- c("AgeGroup", "Recurred", "Count")

# Interactive plot
plot_ly(age_recurr, x = ~AgeGroup, y = ~Count, color = ~Recurred, type = 'bar') %>%
  layout(barmode = 'group', title = "Recurrence by Age Group",
         xaxis = list(title = "Age Group"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Count"))
```


In the interactive bar plot above, the 31–50 age group shows the highest number of recurrence cases compared to other age groups. This group also has the highest overall patient count, including those who did not experience a recurrence. The second highest number of recurrence cases is observed in the 51–70 age group.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create a data frame of stage & response
stage_response <- as.data.frame(table(thyroid_data$Stage, thyroid_data$Response))
colnames(stage_response) <- c("Stage", "Response", "Count")

# Interactive plot
plot_ly(stage_response, x = ~Stage, y = ~Count, color = ~Response, type = 'bar') %>%
  layout(barmode = 'group', title = "Treatment Response by Stage",
         xaxis = list(title = "Stage"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Count"))
```


The interactive bar plot reveals that Stage I had the highest overall case count and dominated across all treatment response categories. Among these, the most frequent response was excellent, followed by structural incomplete and indeterminate responses.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ggplot gender vs pathology by recurrence 
ggplot(thyroid_data, aes(x = Gender, fill = Recurred)) +
  # bar plot
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Pathology) +
  # Labels
  labs(
    title = "Gender vs. Pathology (Colored by Recurrence)",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Patient Count",
    fill = "Recurred"
  ) +
  # Theme 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

This bar plot breaks down gender distribution across different thyroid cancer pathologies, with recurrence status represented by color.

- Papillary carcinoma is the most common type, especially among females, who show a high number of both recurrence and non-recurrence cases.

- For Micropapillary and Follicular types, recurrence is relatively low, with females again being more affected than males.

- Hurthle cell cases are rare but appear in both genders, with recurrence present in a small number of cases.

> Overall, female patients dominate across all pathology types, and recurrence is most notable in Papillary carcinoma for both genders, but especially in males.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ggplot stage vs recurred
ggplot(thyroid_data, aes(x = Stage, fill = Recurred)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~ Response) +
  # Labels 
  labs(title = "Stage vs Response, Colored by Recurrence", y = "Proportion")
```

This bar plot illustrates the distribution of cancer stages and treatment responses, with recurrence status indicated by color. Notably, patients with a structural incomplete response almost always experienced a recurrence of thyroid cancer, whereas those with an excellent response rarely had recurrences. Among Stage II cases, biochemical incomplete responses were associated with more recurrences compared to indeterminate responses. Additionally, for indeterminate responses, Stage I had more cases without recurrence than Stage II.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ggplot lymph nodes vs risk 
ggplot(thyroid_data, aes(x = N, fill = Risk)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Recurred) +
  # Labels 
  labs(
    title = "Lymph Node Classification (N) vs Recurrence, Colored by Risk",
    x = "Lymph Node Classification (N)",
    y = "Patient Count",
    fill = "Risk Level"
  ) +
  # Theme
  theme_minimal() 
```

The bar plot above shows the relationship between lymph node classification and recurrence, with risk levels indicated by color. Patients classified as N0 exhibited low risk in both recurrence and non-recurrence groups. N1b had the highest number of recurrences, particularly among intermediate and high-risk categories. In the no recurrence group, only low and intermediate risk levels were observed, while the recurrence group included all three risk levels. For N1a cases with recurrence, only intermediate and high-risk levels were present, with intermediate being the most common.
