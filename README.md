# A Data-Driven Approach to Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction
## Overview
This project analyzes patterns and predictors of thyroid cancer recurrence in patients treated with Radioactive Iodine (RAI) therapy. The dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aneevinay/thyroid-cancer-recurrence-dataset?select=filtered_thyroid_data.csv) includes demographic, pathological, and clinical variables to help identify key factors associated with recurrence and variations in treatment response across patient groups.

## Why It Matters
Understanding the recurrence of thyroid cancer is essential for:

-	Improving risk prediction models
-	Tailoring treatment plans to individual patients
-	Enhancing long-term outcomes by reducing recurrence through optimized care

By identifying which factors are most strongly linked to recurrence, clinicians can make more informed decisions about post-treatment monitoring and therapy options.

## Key Insights
-	Treatment response is the strongest predictor of thyroid cancer recurrence, with excellent response linked to lower recurrence rates.
-	Recurrence is most common in papillary carcinoma, particularly in males aged 31â€“50, who also represent the largest patient group.
-	N1b lymph node classification is associated with the highest recurrence risk, especially in intermediate and high-risk patients.
